# cfn-lint [![CircleCI](https://img.shields.io/circleci/project/github/martysweet/cfn-lint.svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/martysweet/cfn-lint) [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/cfn-lint.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cfn-lint) [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/cfn-lint.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cfn-lint)

A more friendly CloudFormation JSON and YAML Validator

`cfn-lint` is a tool used to improve your CloudFormation development cycle. If you are here, you are probably
fed up of waiting for 10 minutes or more before CloudFormation gives you an error due to a typo. This tool aims to 
remove that waste of time. The tool takes the CloudFormation template, and resolves all the Intrinsic functions 
defined before checking the Properties of Resources defined. 

The tool can be used over the commandline using `cfn-lint`, or can be used as a module within another JavaScript application.

*Note: This tool is currently case-sensitive in relation to AWS CloudFormation types, for example aws::lambda::function != AWS::Lambda::Function.*

## Depreciation/Retirement Notice
This tool was developed before AWS released `cfn-python-lint`, available at https://github.com/awslabs/cfn-python-lint. The AWS tool is better supported, provides additional checks and has best practice recommendations - **if you are looking at implementing a linting tool into your workflow, use https://github.com/awslabs/cfn-python-lint.**

Due to the superiority of the alternative tool, this project, `cfn-lint` has entered retirement. To support the existing community using this tool (both the CLI and API), the `cfn-lint` npm package will remain and will be supported in the following ways:
- Minor bug fixes
- Updates to SAM and CloudFormation Specification
- Security updates

Additional features may be added at the discretion of the project maintainers, however, **we strongly advise you use `cfn-python-lint` at https://github.com/awslabs/cfn-python-lint instead of this project.**

## Installation

You can install with `npm`:

```
$ npm install -g cfn-lint
```

If you get `/usr/bin/env: 'node': No such file or directory` ensure your system has NodeJs installed. On Debian systems you may need to symlink node to nodejs due to namespacing issues (`ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node`).


## How to use?
`cfn-lint validate my_template.yaml`

`cfn-lint validate my_template.json`

`cfn-lint validate my_template.yaml --parameters key="my value",key2=value2,key3=3`

`cfn-lint validate my_template.yaml --parameters key="my value",key2=value2 --no-guess-parameters`

`cfn-lint validate my_template.yaml --pseudo AWS::StackName="My-Stack"`

`cfn-lint validate my_template.yaml --parameters key="my value" --pseudo AWS::Region=ap-northeast-1,AWS::AccountId=000000000000`

`cfn-lint docs AWS::Lambda::Function` 

`cfn-lint docs AWS::Lambda::Function.Code`

`cfn-lint docs AWS::Lambda::Function.Code.S3Bucket`

**Note: The order of `--parameters` and `--pseudo` currently matters. This should be addressed in a later release.**

### Example Output
```

Message: Required property ImageId missing for type AWS::EC2::Instance
Documentation: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-ec2-instance.html

Resource: Resources > MyInstance > Properties
Message: Required property Value missing for type Tag
Documentation: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/search/doc-search.html?searchPath=documentation-guide&searchQuery=Tag&x=0&y=0&this_doc_product=AWS+CloudFormation&this_doc_guide=User+Guide&doc_locale=en_us#facet_doc_product=AWS%20CloudFormation&facet_doc_guide=User%20Guide

Template invalid!
```

### Flags

#### Input Parameters
`--parameters <param values>`: Provide a list of comma-separated key=value pairs of parameters to use when validating your template. If a parameter is not specified here, `cfn-lint` will guess a mock value based on the Parameter's Type and AllowedValues. e.g.`--parameters InstanceType=t2.micro,Memory=512`

#### AWS Pseudo Parameter Override
`--pseudo <psuedo param values>`: Provide a list of comma-separated key=value pairs of CloudFormation pseudo-parameters to use when validating your template. e.g.`--pseudo AWS::Region=ap-southeast-2`

#### Import Values
`--import-values <param values>`:  Provide a list of comma-separated key=value pairs of CloudFormation import values to use when validating your template. e.g.`--import-values MyDeployedVPC=vpc-1a2b3c4d`

#### Parameter Guessing
`--guess-parameters`: Guess any parameters if they don't have any Default value in the template. Parameters will be guessed/mocked based on their `AllowedValues` or `Type`. This is the default behaviour; it's only included as an option for explicitness.

`--no-guess-parameters`: Disable the guessing of parameters if they don't have a Default. If you don't provide them on the CLI in this situation, a critical error will be raised instead of the parameter value being mocked.

`--only-guess-parameters <param names>`: Only guess the provided parameters, and disable the guessing of all others without Defaults. A critical error will be raised for missing parameters, as above. e.g. `--only-guess-parameters InstanceType,Memory`

#### User-defined Resource Attributes
`--custom-resource-attributes <attribute values>`: Provide a list of comma-separated key=value pairs of resource attributes using either resource-type notation (e.g. `AWS::CloudFormation::CustomResource.SomeAttribute`) or logical-name notation (e.g. `SomethingPretty.SomeAttribute`) and their expected values, to use when validating your template. If a custom resource attribute is not specified here, `cfn-lint` will guess a mock value. e.g.`--custom-resource-attributes AWS::CloudFormation::CustomResource.SomeAttribute=[1\\,2],Custom::Dooby.SomeAttribute=[1\\,2],SomethingPretty.SomeAttribute=123`

#### Verbose Output
`--verbose`: Provide verbose output and stack traces when template parsing fails.

** Note ** : Parameter values that contain commas must be escaped using a backslash (e.g. `Param1=[1\,2\,3]`). Depending on your command-line interpreter you may have to use double backslashes or enclose the entire argument in quotes, such is the case with *Bash* and other *Bourne*-based shells (e.g. `--parameters 'Param1=[1\,2\,3]'`).

### API
`cfn-lint` can also be used as a Node library:
```ts
const cfnLint = require('cfn-lint')
```

The following methods are considered public:

```ts
cfnLint.validateFile(fileName: string, options?: ValidationOptions): ValidationResult
```
Validates a file, and returns an ValidationResult with the results.


```ts
cfnLint.validateJsonObject(object: any, options?: ValidationOptions): ValidationResult
```
Validates an object, and returns an ValidationResult with the results. The object
is what you might get from `JSON.parse`ing a Cloudformation template.


```ts
interface ValidationOptions {
  parameters?: {
    Param1: Param1value,
    // ...
  }
  pseudoParameters?: {
    'AWS::Region': 'ap-southeast-2',
    // ...
  },
  guessParameters?: string[] | undefined // default undefined
}
```
`parameters` get passed into the template's Parameters before validation, and `pseudoParameters` are used to override AWS' pseudo-parameters, like `AWS::Region`, `AWS::AccountId`, etc.

If `guessParameters` is set to a list of parameter names, a critical error will be raised if any Parameter with no Default is not specified in the `parameters` or `guessParameters` options. An empty list can be used to enforce that all parameters must be specified in `parameters`. Leaving as `undefined` preserves the default loose behaviour, where parameters are guessed as needed without causing an error.

```ts
interface ErrorRecord {
  message: string,
  resource: string,
  documentation: string
}
interface ValidationResult {
  templateValid: boolean,
  errors: {
    crit: ErrorRecord[],
    warn: ErrorRecord[],
    info: ErrorRecord[]
  },
  outputs: {
      [outputName: string]: string;
  };
  exports: {
      [outputName: string]: string;
  };
}
```
Represents the result of a validation.


## Deploying your template

CloudFormation tends to involve a bit of trail and error. To enable quick development, 
the following method can be used to prevent the annoying 'ROLLBACK' scenarios where the whole stack
must be deleted and recreated.

Deploy a template with the following content, name it what you want your final stack to be called.
```yaml
Resources:
  MyBucket:
    Type: AWS::S3::Bucket
```

After each change to your template, simply update the stack you just created. If the stack failed to deploy
for some reason you can perform an 'Update Stack' operation, without needing to delete and recreate
the stack from scratch. You can also use this method to keep parameters populated during the development 
phase. This method will work using the AWS Console or the CLI tools.


## FAQ

### No errors were thrown for my template but it still failed when deploying! Is this tool pointless?!
Hopefully `cfn-lint` caught some errors before you deployed your template, however, catching every single
error before deployment is extremely tricky. Please help out the community by explaining how you
managed to get an error from CloudFormation of which the validator did not detect, the following information
will help in adding a check to the utility:

* The Resource/Statement which caused the error
* The error thrown from CloudFormation
* The working Resource/Statement which resolves the error

You can add an issue on the [Github Issue Page](https://github.com/martysweet/cfn-lint/issues). Thanks for helping out!

### Doesn't the AWS API provide this functionality?
Partially. The AWS API `cloudformation validate-template` only checks the validity of the template, this includes the
expected parameters for intrinsic functions, resource types and general structure of the JSON or YAML template it has been given. The
AWS API does not detect incorrect resource property names or incorrect resource property types (e.g. string, bool, list) which are typically 
only detected when CloudFormation attempts to deploy the resources with the incorrect configurations.

### How does cfn-lint know what is valid?
AWS provide a CloudFormation specification file for each region. cfn-lint uses the US East (N. Virginia) CloudFormationResourceSpecification.json
file available on the [AWS CloudFormation Resource Specification](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-resource-specification.html) page.
Currently, updates of this JSON file are manual and baked into each major, minor or bug fix release as needed.

## Development

### Language

This project is written in [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/home.html), a
superset of JavaScript which allows for type checking at compile time. The project currently
aims to support Node 4 and above.

### Unit Tests

Tests can be run using `npm test`. There should be a test case for every template error, 
for example an invalid parameter for `Fn::Join` or an incorrect reference for `Ref`. 
The tests depend on `Mocha` and `chai`.

### IDE Setup

If you use a JetBrains editor, the following Run Configuration can be setup 
for the Mocha test suite:

Node Options: None
Extra Mocha Options: None
Test Directory: <working dir>/lib/test

### Local testing of CLI

Environmental Variables
* DEBUG - Set to receive runtime debug messages

```
$ npm link
$ cfn-lint <some command>
```

### Resource Attribute Mocking
In order to simulate the intrinsic functions to catch errors before deployment,
attributes for Properties and Resources are mocked. This can be seen within the 
`assignResourcesOutputs()` and `assignParameterOutputs()` of [validator.es6](src/validator.es6).
A resource will always have a Ref of `mock-ref-RESOURCENAME` and will be attached other
attributes which can be used with the `Fn::GetAtt` function. This allows for checking
if attributes exist for a specific resource before deploying the template for real.

### Intrinsic Functions

Each intrinsic function has a signature of `doIntrinsicXYZ(ref, key)` and is called by the
`resolveIntrinsicFunction(ref, key)` function. The `doIntrinsic..` function should return
the resolved value of the function. For example, for Fn::Sub, an input of `"My ${MyInstance}"`
would return a string similar to `"My i-0a0a0a0a0a`.

### Parameterized types

Type parameterization is a technique primarily used in `cfn-lint` for supporting *SAM* validation as well as user-defined resource attributes, by allowing a certain resource type or property type to have it's specification enhanced/overridden by another registered type, dynamically.

Prime examples for a parameterized resource type, property type and even a mixture of both would respectively be: `AWS::S3::Bucket<somethingCool>`, `AWS::S3::Bucket.BucketEncryption<somethingAwesome>` and `AWS::S3::Bucket<somethingCool>.BucketEncryption<somethingAwesome>`; where `somethingCool` and `somethingAwesome` can be any registered resource (e.g. `AWS::CodeBuild::Project`) or property type (e.g. `AWS::CodeBuild::Project.Artifacts`).

In regards to user-defined resource attributes that are applicable to a given resource based on its' logical ID, the parameter's value would be the logical ID (e.g. `AWS::S3::Bucket<somethingCool>`, where `somethingCool` is the logical ID that's present in the specific template), which has been previously registered as a type with it's respective specification.

Apart from the above mentioned, parameterization is also used for specifying the item type of an aggregate type (i.e. `List` or `Map`) and usually occurs within the `Type` attribute of property specifications when a property may take multiple forms such as in *SAM* templates.

### SAM validation process

Due to the fact that *SAM* templates support various types or even a mixture of types for a given template property value and that `cfn-lint`'s validation algorithm is designed for the *CFN* specification that does not, therefore, in order to attain compatibility between the different formats, a property type inference procedure was implemented, namely `applySAMPropertyOverrides`, that scans the template, attempts to determine the actual type of a given *SAM* property based on it's value type or shape in template, if applicable and if successful it then registers a logical name override for the resource in question with the disambiguated specification.

In addition, *SAM* templates also require a transformation process, entailing new resources to be generated according to the node-tree matching patterns defined in the `data/sam_20161031_output_resources.json` file and placed in a distinct section, namely `SAMOutput`, by the `doSAMTransform` procedure so that they can later be utilized within intrinsics.

`cfn-lint` supports SAM template validation by extending the current *CFN* specification with additional *SAM* specific resources that are defined in the `data/sam_20161031_cfn.json` file (i.e. `applySpecificationOverrides`), optionally enhancing the definitions of specific entries that reside under the `Resources` section of a to-be-validated template with definitions extracted from the `Globals` section of the aforementioned template (i.e. `processSAMGlobals`) and finally, before the actual template resource validation takes place, the template is recursively scanned and specific resources are generated under the `SAMOutput` section (i.e. `doSAMTransform`), in a two phase approach, one that occurs before values are assigned to parameters and resource properties/attributes as well as intrinsic resolution and another one after the aforementioned so that the inference process can disambiguate between an arbitrary number of *SAM* types that define a specific template resource property.

Known limitations:

- Primitive types `Integer`, `Long` and `Double` are indistinguishable;
- Primitive types `String` and `Timestamp` are indistinguishable;
- [SAM policy templates](https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model/blob/develop/docs/policy_templates.rst#policy-templates) are not implemented;
